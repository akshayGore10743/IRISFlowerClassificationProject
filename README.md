# IRIS Flower Classification

## Overview
This project aims to classify iris flowers into different species using machine learning. The dataset contains features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. The notebook covers data visualization, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of three iris species:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

Each instance includes four feature measurements used for classification.

## Technologies & Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used:

- `numpy` (Numerical computing)
- `pandas` (Data manipulation and analysis)
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (Data visualization)
- `sklearn.model_selection` (Train-test split)
- `sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier` (K-Nearest Neighbors Model)
- `sklearn.metrics` (Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

## Usage Instructions
1. Open Google Colab.
2. Upload the `IRISFlowerClassification.ipynb` file.
3. Run the notebook cell by cell.
4. Ensure you have the required libraries installed using:
   ```python
   !pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
5. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

## Model Training & Evaluation
- The dataset is split into **training** and **testing** sets.
- A **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier** is used for classification.
- The model's performance is evaluated using **accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report**.

## Results & Findings
- Data visualization helps understand feature distributions among species.
- KNN provides effective classification for the iris dataset.
- The trained model achieves high accuracy in classifying iris species.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different machine learning models like Decision Trees or Support Vector Machines.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
